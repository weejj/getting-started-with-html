BASICS OF THE WEB<BR>
- <b>BROWSER</b> - a native application running on the computer that can request and display HTML documents<br>
- <B>HTML</B> - the "documents" of the web<br>
- <b>URL</b> - the address/location of the documents of the web<br>
- <b>HTTP</b> - the protocol of the web (the way/method of the request that is sent from your browser to the server and also used by the server when it returns a HTML document to your browser<br>
<br>
MAJOR PIECES OF THE WEB<br>
- (1) You<br>
- (2) your computer<br>
- (3) a browser running on your computer<br> 
- (4) "the internet"<br> 
- (5) a server <br>
<br>
HOW THE WEB WORKS<br>You as the user will utilize your computer, and one of the browsers available (Firefox, Safari, IE, Chrome) to access a webpage, e.g., "www.wikipedia.org". If you type in "www.wikipedia.org" in the <b>URL</b> address bar of your browser, the browser will utilize the <b>HTTP</b> protocol in order to send a request to the server, basically asking the server to "Send me your <b>HTML</b> documents". The server will respond to the request, and send back to the browser a <b>HTML</b> document for the browser to interpret and display. Here is a great video from YouTube.com explaining <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_LPdttKXPc"> how the web works. </a> 
<BR></BR>
HTML<br>
- HTML is the <em>heart</em> of the web<br>
- Stands for <em> HyperText Markup Language</em><br>
- HTML is made up of: (1) <b>text content</b> - what you see, (2) <b>markup</b> - what it looks like, (3) <b>references</b> - to other documents, e.g., images & videos, (4) <b>links</b> - to other pages<BR></BR>
HTML MARKUP<br>
- <b>whitespace</b> - is interperated as NULL by the browser, i.e., the browser will not display them unless it is close to a value. And regardless how many spaces, the browser will only display 1 blank space. So in order to force a linebreak, create a paragraph, etc., we will have to use <b>HTML markup</b> tags. <br>
- <b>standard format for these tags are </b> - < name > content < /name > <br>
- <b>this is the</b> --------------------------------opening tag---------closing tag----<br>
- <b>this whole ting is an</b> ------------------|< ----------element------------- >|
<BR></BR>
HTML ATTRIBUTES<br>
- <b>standard format for a link</b> - < a href="value" > contents < /a ><br>
- example: < a href="www.reddit.com" > derp < /a ><br>
- in this example "href" = attribute name, "www.reddit.com" = value<br>
- <b>standard format for an image</b> - < img src="url" alt="text" ><br>
- example: < img src="xyz" alt="dog" ><br> <img src="http://png-3.findicons.com/files/icons/367/ifunny/128/dog.png" alt="dog"><br>
- in this example "src" = attribute name, "xyz" the location of the image to be displayed, and 'dog' the alternative text. The alternative text is not needed but as a standard it should have a value. If the image for some reason is not available the browser will display this text. It is also beneficial for individuals with bad vision, or for web crawlers trying to index your webpage. A computer will not be able to know what an image shows, unless the alternative text is there.<br>
- NB. Notice that this has no closing tag. This is because this is a type "Void Tag". Void Tags has no content, so no need for closing tag.<br>
- In addition to Void Tags, all tags are also one of either types: <b>Inline</b> or <b>block</b><br>
- well known <em>inline</em> tags are < br > , < em > </em>and < span >. An inline element occupies only the space bounded by the tags that define the inline element.<br>
- well known <em>block</em> tags are < p > and < div >. Block tags will create a block/box around whatever it contains, and gives the user the possibility of setting property/methods for that element.

STUPID IS AS STUPID DOES<br>
Computers are often characterized as very stupid, since they are only able to tell the difference between 1s and 0s. Their strength is that they can do this task many million times in a minute. So if you break down a problem or task, and give specific instructions, it will be able to do that very effictively. And don't worry, you will not have to feed it to the computer in binary code.
